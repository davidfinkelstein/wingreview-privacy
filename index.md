### Information collected automatically
- **Device and app usage data:** device type, iOS version, and basic app version info (to help with compatibility and troubleshooting).
- **Diagnostics:** We may receive crash reports and basic diagnostic information (for example, through Apple’s tools) to improve stability and fix bugs. We use diagnostic information only to improve stability and fix bugs, not for advertising.
  
### Location (if you enable it)

## How We Use Information
We use your information to:

- Improve performance and fix bugs
- Communicate with you (support, important account or policy updates)

## Sharing of Information
We may share information:
- **With service providers:** We use trusted vendors to operate and improve the app:

  - **OneSignal** helps us send push notifications. OneSignal processes device information such as a push notification token and may process notification delivery/interaction data (for example, whether a notification was delivered or opened) to deliver notifications reliably.
- **For safety and legal reasons** (e.g., to comply with law or respond to valid requests)
- **With other users**: your profile and User Content may be visible to others

We do **not** sell your personal information.

## User-Generated Content and Safety
If you believe content is objectionable, please contact us at: **wingreviewhelp@gmail.com**.
We may remove content/accounts that violate our rules or applicable law.

## Data Retention
We keep information as long as needed to provide the service and for legitimate business purposes (e.g., security, compliance).
If you delete your account, we delete or de-identify your personal data within a reasonable period, except where required for security/legal reasons. Backups may persist for a limited time.

## Your Choices & Rights
